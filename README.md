# RSI Signals Indicator of RSI Oscillator

This code represents the RSI Signals Indicator of RSI Oscillator, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is an indicator that calculates the Relative Strength Index (RSI) values and generates signals based on the overbought and oversold levels.

## Indicator Parameters

- `AppliedPrice`: The type of price used for calculations. By default, it is set to `PRICE_CLOSE`.
- `RsiPeriod`: The period used to calculate the RSI. By default, it is set to 14.
- `OverboughtLevel`: The level at which the indicator considers the market to be overbought. By default, it is set to 70.
- `OversoldLevel`: The level at which the indicator considers the market to be oversold. By default, it is set to 30.

## Indicator Buffers

- `RsiBuffer[]`: Stores the calculated RSI values.
- `SignalBuffer[]`: Stores the generated signals.

## Initialization

The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the indicator. It sets the indicator buffers, assigns a name to the indicator, and returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED` if the initialization is successful.

## Deinitialization

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the indicator is removed from the chart. It cleans up the indicator buffers by resizing them to 0.

## Calculation

The `OnCalculate()` function is called for each new tick or bar on the chart. It calculates the RSI values using the `iRSI()` function and stores them in the `RsiBuffer[]`. Then, it generates signals based on the RSI values and stores them in the `SignalBuffer[]`.

The signals are generated as follows:
- If the RSI value is above the `OverboughtLevel`, a signal of 1 (overbought) is generated.
- If the RSI value is below the `OversoldLevel`, a signal of -1 (oversold) is generated.
- Otherwise, a signal of 0 (no signal) is generated.
